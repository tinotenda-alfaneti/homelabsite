                <h2>The Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Atarnet Homelab is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure running on ARM64 hardware, designed to 
                    implement and test enterprise-grade practices in a self-hosted environment. The cluster runs 
                    production workloads with proper CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and security controls—treating 
                    home infrastructure with the same engineering discipline as commercial systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By day, I'm a Software Engineer, Infrastructure Engineer, and Cloud Engineer architecting and building 
                    production systems. By night, I'm the DevOps engineer, the SRE, the security team, and the infrastructure 
                    specialist—all rolled into one. This hands-on approach has taught me more about distributed systems, 
                    container orchestration, and production operations than any certification ever could.

                <h2>Why Build a Homelab?</h2>
                <p>
                    The real question is: why not? In an era where "it works on my machine" becomes "it works in production," 
                    understanding the full stack—from bare metal to application—is invaluable. My homelab serves three critical purposes:
                </p>

                    <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Experimenting with cutting-edge technologies like Kubernetes operators, service meshes, and GitOps workflows</li>
                    <li><strong>Real Production Experience:</strong> Running actual services with real users teaches lessons no tutorial can provide</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-Sufficiency:</strong> Taking control of my data, my applications, and my digital life away from big tech</li>

            <section class="about-section">
                <h2>The Technology Philosophy</h2>
                <p>
                    Every technology choice is deliberate. I favor Go for its performance, single-binary deployments, 
                    and excellent standard library. React powers rich frontends when needed, while HTMX keeps things 
                    lightweight for simpler interfaces. Kubernetes provides the orchestration layer, and I chose MicroK8s 
                    for its lightweight design, snap-based installation, and excellent ARM64 support on Raspberry Pi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Security isn't an afterthought—it's baked in from the start. All traffic flows through Cloudflare's 
                    zero-trust network, containers run with minimal privileges, images are scanned before deployment, 
                    and secrets never touch version control.
                </p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    Building and maintaining production infrastructure teaches lessons that no book or course can convey:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to debug a pod stuck in CrashLoopBackOff at 2 AM</li>
                    <li>Why idempotent deployments save you from catastrophic rollbacks</li>
                    <li>The importance of backups (learned the hard way)</li>
                    <li>How to optimize resource limits to squeeze every bit of performance</li>
                    <li>Why monitoring and alerting are non-negotiable in production</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Every outage is a learning opportunity. Every performance bottleneck is a chance to dive deeper 
                    into system internals. Every security vulnerability discovered is a reminder to stay paranoid.

                <p>
                    The homelab is never "done." It's a living, evolving system that grows with emerging technologies 
                    and personal curiosity. Current experiments and future plans include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GitOps with ArgoCD for declarative, Git-driven deployments</li>
                    <li>Service mesh exploration with Istio or Linkerd for advanced traffic management</li>
                    <li>Automated disaster recovery and backup strategies with Velero</li>
                    <li>Distributed tracing implementation with Jaeger and OpenTelemetry</li>
                    <li>Expanding the ARM cluster with additional Raspberry Pi nodes</li>
                    <li>Advanced CI/CD pipeline improvements and security hardening</li>

                <p>
                    Whether you're building your own homelab, wrestling with Kubernetes, or just curious about 
                    infrastructure engineering, I'd love to hear from you. Check out the blog for technical deep-dives, 
                    explore the services to see what's possible, or reach out via 
                    <a href="https://github.com/tinotenda-alfaneti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> 
                    to collaborate on open-source projects.

                <p>
                    This journey is documented openly—successes, failures, and everything in between. Because the best 
                    way to learn is to build, break, fix, and share the knowledge along the way.
